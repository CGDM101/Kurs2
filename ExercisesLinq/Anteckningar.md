The Linq library is implemented as a set of extension methods on the IEnumerable<T> interface.

The IEnumerable<T> interface is central to Linq. All Linq methods are extension methods to the IEnumerable<T> interface; so you can call any Linq method on any object that implements IEnumerable<T>.

It is an interface that guarantees that a given class is iterable.

A <T> after an interface indicates that the interface is generic . it can be used with any type and the T is the placeholder for that type.
